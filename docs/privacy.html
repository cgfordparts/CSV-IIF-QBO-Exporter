    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: February 13, 2026</p>
    
    <p>The Shopify & IIF Transaction Reporter ("the Application") is an internal business utility designed for the conversion and synchronization of financial data between Shopify/IIF files and QuickBooks Online (QBO).</p>

    <h3>1. Data Collection and Processing</h3>
    <p>The Application is a local-first desktop utility. We do not collect, store, or harvest any personal or financial data. All data processing (parsing of CSV and IIF files) occurs entirely on your local machine. No data is ever transmitted to the developer's servers or any third-party analytics services.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Transmission to QuickBooks Online</h3>
    <p>Financial data from your uploaded files is transmitted directly to QuickBooks Online via official Intuit OAuth2 APIs. All transmissions are encrypted using industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols. We only access the "Accounting" and "OpenID" scopes required to perform the synchronization tasks you initiate.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
    <p>The Application does not maintain a database of your financial records. Once a synchronization task is complete or the Application is closed, transient data is cleared from memory. Your QuickBooks Online data remains securely stored within your Intuit account, subject to Intuit’s own retention policies.</p>

    <h3>4. User Rights and Control</h3>
    <p>You have full control over the data synchronization process. You may revoke the Application's access to your QuickBooks Online account at any time through your Intuit account settings or by using the disconnect feature within the Application.</p>

    <h3>5. Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your financial data by utilizing official OAuth2 protocols, meaning your QuickBooks credentials are never seen or stored by the Application. Access tokens are stored locally on your machine using standard OS-level encryption where available.</p>

    <h3>6. Contact Information</h3>
    <p>For questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the Application's data practices, please contact the developer via the official GitHub repository for this project.</p>
